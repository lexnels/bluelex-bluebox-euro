Unofficial firmware mod for the 1010music **bluebox eurorack edition** (not the desktop bluebox; their firmware
differs). It patches the official firmware and adds features to it. Everything stock still works.

**Based on:** the official bluebox eurorack edition firmware **version 1.5.1** from 1010music, the file
`BLUEEURO.BIN` (1,113,628 bytes, SHA-256 `fcb04565e2fd5bc15c0b2d0dc913dc99dc74732611e8cef0d7e8e4bb4af7402b`).
The patcher only accepts that exact file, so it won't work on other versions.

The CPU meter, reverb and delay additions run on a real unit; the compressor meter, Saturate and USB Out are tested in
an emulator so far. Keep your stock firmware file so you can go back at any
time.

## What it adds

- **CPU meter:** a thin bar at the top right of the screen, right of the clock, showing the audio engine's load.
  Green, amber above 70 %, red above 90 %; a white tick marks the recent peak.
- **Four new reverb styles**, after the stock 15:
  - **FDN Hall**: a lush, smooth hall built for this mod (an 8-line modulated feedback delay network).
    Source: [`src/hall_dsp.h`](src/hall_dsp.h).
  - **MVerb**: a dense plate/hall, ported from Martin Eastwood's [MVerb](https://github.com/martineastwood/mverb).
    Port: [`src/rev_mverb.h`](src/rev_mverb.h).
  - **Squall**: the Mutable Instruments Clouds reverb, as voiced in
    [Squall](https://github.com/DanielMajid/squall_reverb). Port: [`src/rev_squall.h`](src/rev_squall.h).
  - **Freeverb**: the classic [Freeverb](https://github.com/sinshu/freeverb).
    Port: [`src/rev_freeverb.h`](src/rev_freeverb.h).

  The three ports share a wrapper, [`src/rev_common.h`](src/rev_common.h), for low cut, pre-delay, width and level.
- **More reverb controls on the panel:** **Diffusion**, **Spread** and **Size** knobs, with **Freeze** moved to its
  own column on the right. Diffusion and Spread also work on the stock styles; Size works on the four new styles.
- **Each reverb style remembers its knobs.** Switch away and back, and its settings (and the knobs on screen) come
  back. Until power-off.
- **Delay:** the stock **Cutoff** and **Width** band-pass (on with **FILT**) plus:
  - **Pitch** (with a **PITCH** on/off button): shifts each repeat by -12 to +12 semitones, like speeding up or
    slowing down tape, so with Feedback every repeat climbs or falls again (+12: an octave, two octaves, ...). With
    PING on, every bounce, left or right, is one more step.
  - **Drift**: a slow, wandering tape-style pitch bend on the repeats, clearly audible at full (about ±2.5 %).
  - **Send**: feeds the echoes into the reverb.

  BEAT and PING sit in a column to the left of the knobs; FILT is under Send, and PITCH and QUAD (3&4 mode) are in
  the column on the right.
  Source: [`src/dly_m7.h`](src/dly_m7.h) (audio), [`src/dly_m4.c`](src/dly_m4.c) (new params).
- **Compressor meter:** in the settings list, with the master compressor on, the **Thresh** row gets a blue bar along
  its bottom edge showing how much the compressor is turning the master down, updating about 15 times a second. The
  scale is stretched at the low end so light compression shows clearly: 2 dB fills a fifth of the row, 10 dB half,
  40 dB all of it, with ticks at 5, 10 and 20 dB. Dark when nothing is being compressed.
- **Master saturator:** a **Saturate** control at the bottom of the settings page (after the compressor's). Saturation
  on the master bus after the compressor, before the master level, so it's in recordings too. At 0 it's off and the
  sound is untouched; low settings round off peaks, and higher ones push up to 36 dB into the clipper for overdrive.
  The level is compensated as it goes up: peaks top out at -14 dBFS, so a full mix gets quieter rather than louder
  (quiet material still comes up some, as with any saturation). It's saved with the project like the other settings.
  Source: [`src/mst_m7.c`](src/mst_m7.c).
- **USB Out setting:** **USB Out** in the settings, under Phones Src: **Multichannel** (stock, all 18 channels to the
  computer) or **Master only** (2 channels, the master L/R, just what the main outs play, so the saturator and
  compressor are in it). Changing it makes the computer see the bluebox unplug and plug back in as a different
  2-channel or 18-channel device, which takes about a second; audio to the computer stops while it does. USB audio
  from the computer and MIDI work the same in both modes. It's saved with the project; with Master only saved, the
  bluebox starts as 18 channels and switches about a second after boot. Source: [`src/usb_m7.c`](src/usb_m7.c).

The panels, two columns per encoder page:

| panel | page 1 | page 2 | page 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reverb | Time, Level, Diffusion, Spread | Size, Pre Delay, Low Cut, HI C | Freeze |
| Delay | Delay, Feedback, Cutoff, Width | Pitch, Drift, Send, FILT | BEAT, PING, PITCH, QUAD (3&4 mode) |

Good to know:
- Switching to or from one of the new styles mutes the reverb for a moment while its memory is cleared.
- On MVerb, Size takes effect when you stop turning the knob, with a short dropout.
- A project saved with one of the new styles won't load that style on stock firmware.
- Cutoff runs from 80 Hz to 10 kHz and Width from half an octave to 8 octaves, as stock.
- Pitch is plain resampling: the delay reads its memory faster or slower and jumps back every delay time (at most
  every 100 ms) with a short crossfade. So pitched repeats land up to 100 ms early or late, going up repeats a little
  of the sound and going down skips a little. With Pitch at 0 or PITCH off the repeats are untouched.
- Drift adds up to 16 ms to the delay time. The delay's send reaches the reverb 0.7 ms late (the
  reverb runs first).

## Install

You need your own copy of the official bluebox eurorack firmware **version 1.5.1** from 1010music (the mod can't include
it).

**In your browser (easiest):** open the [web patcher](https://lexnels.github.io/bluelex-bluebox-euro/), choose
your stock 1.5.1 `BLUEEURO.BIN`, and save the modded `BLUEEURO.BIN` it gives you. The file never leaves your computer: the page
patches it locally. If your browser saves it as `BLUEEURO (1).BIN` because the stock file is in the same folder,
rename it to `BLUEEURO.BIN`. Then copy it to the microSD card as in step 3 below.

**Or with Python 3** (built into macOS; on Windows get it from python.org):

1. Download [`releases/bluebox-mod-v0.15-patcher.py`](https://github.com/lexnels/bluelex-bluebox-euro/raw/main/releases/bluebox-mod-v0.15-patcher.py)
   (the newest patcher in the [`releases`](releases) folder).
2. In a terminal, run it on your stock firmware file:
   ```
   python3 bluebox-mod-v0.15-patcher.py "path/to/stock/BLUEEURO.BIN"
   ```
   It checks that the file is the right stock firmware, then writes the modded `BLUEEURO.BIN` into a `modded` folder
   next to the patcher, so your stock file is never overwritten.
3. Copy the modded `BLUEEURO.BIN` to the root of the microSD card and install it like a 1010music update by booting while holding the A button.

### Going back to stock firmware

> **Back up your projects first** (copy the whole microSD card to your computer). Projects saved with the modded
> firmware won't work with the stock firmware, so after rolling back you can only use projects saved before you
> installed the mod.

1. Back up the microSD card to your computer.
2. Delete the projects you saved while running the modded firmware.
3. Delete the settings files on the card.
4. Copy your stock `BLUEEURO.BIN` (version 1.5.1) to the root of the card and install it like a 1010music update by
   booting while holding the A button.

# Technical notes

## The reverb styles in detail

Four reverb styles after the stock 15 (Clouds), each with its own engine running in the stock reverb's delay memory:

| style | engine | source |
|---|---|---|
| FDN Hall | pre-delay, a 3-stage 8-channel diffuser, then an 8-line feedback delay network with modulated lines, two-band decay, damping and an allpass in each line, mixed by an 8x8 Hadamard matrix (`src/hall_dsp.h`) | written for this mod |
| MVerb | Dattorro-style plate/hall tank (`src/rev_mverb.h`) | port of [martineastwood/mverb](https://github.com/martineastwood/mverb), **GPL-3.0** |
| Squall | the Mutable Instruments Clouds reverb as voiced in Squall (`src/rev_squall.h`) | [DanielMajid/squall_reverb](https://github.com/DanielMajid/squall_reverb); reverb core by Emilie Gillet, MIT |
| Freeverb | 8 combs + 4 allpasses per side (`src/rev_freeverb.h`) | [sinshu/freeverb](https://github.com/sinshu/freeverb), Jezar's public-domain original |

MVerb, Squall and Freeverb share a wrapper (`src/rev_common.h`) that adds the low cut, pre-delay, stereo width, level
and a fade-in they lack.

What each control does per style:

| control | FDN Hall | MVerb | Squall | Freeverb |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Time | decay 0.4 s / 3.2 s / 25 s (bottom / middle / top) | decay | loop gain | decay 0.5 s / 2.5 s / 12.5 s |
| Level | output level | output level | output level | output level |
| Diffusion | spread of the input diffuser (smear of the onset) | tank density | allpass amount | allpass feedback |
| Spread | stereo width, -1000 mono, 0 normal, +1000 extra wide | same | same | same |
| Size | room size (delay lengths); the middle is the tuned size; turning it bends pitch briefly | tank size; applied once the knob rests, with a short dropout (MVerb clears its tank) | loop delays x0.5 to x2 | comb lengths x0.5 to x2 |
| Pre Delay | pre-delay, up to ~0.65 s | pre-delay of the tank | pre-delay | pre-delay |
| Low Cut | input high-pass, 20 Hz to 1 kHz | same | same | same |
| HI C | brightness of the input and of the tail | damping and bandwidth | loop low-pass | damping |
| Freeze | holds the tail and ignores new input | same | same | same |

Feedback, modulation, early reflections and Resonance aren't on the panel, so the new styles use fixed, tuned values
for them. Size changes the decay along with the room in MVerb, Squall and Freeverb (Time is quoted at the middle Size).
Pre Delay, Diffusion and Spread are the stock engine's own params; Size (`0x143`) is only used by the new styles and
never reaches the stock engine, whose styles set their own size.

## The delay additions in detail

The stock delay (FX1: vtable `0x0806ba64`, bus 13, wet only) reads its delayed signal, runs a band-pass on it when
Filt is on, feeds it back into its lines and copies it to its bus. `src/dly_m7.h` hooks that path:

- `dly_process` (vtable slot `0x0806ba70`) picks up the new params from the event queue (the stock loop ignores
  unknown ids), runs the stock body, then keeps Send x the wet output.
- `dly_read` (all nine line reads, `FUN_08059d54`: the output reads plus the in-loop reads of PING and QUAD+PING)
  keeps the stock read and its glide after a time change, then re-reads the same line a variable amount further
  back: Drift, a 0.6 Hz wobble plus a slow random wander (up to 2 x 8 ms); Pitch, a
  read that slides at the pitch ratio and jumps back every delay time (at most 4800 samples) with a 240-sample
  crossfade. Each line read shifts once; in PING mode line C (2T, carrying the right side) shifts twice, since one
  pass through it spans two of the left side's.
- The reverb runs before the delay in each block, so `hall_process` adds the kept send into the reverb's bus (14) at
  the start of the next block.

New ids, free in both cores' tables: `0x3a` Drift (saved under its old key `dlyflutter`), `0x3d` Send (0..1000), `0x4a` Pitch (-12..12, a plain number, type 1), `0x4b` Pitch on/off.
`src/dly_m4.c` defines them in the M4 param table (hooking its last definition, `bl` at `0x0813714a`), the delay's
param list (`FUN_0812060c` case 4, `0x08120bba`) is a table like the reverb's, and the delay panel pages like the
reverb's instead of being pinned to page 1.

The FX panel (`FUN_0812bc60` populate, `FUN_0812c110` layout) draws 10 widgets in 5 columns of 2, from 48 px in, and
hides the rest. Its "hide past 10" check (`0x0812bede`) now allows 12, and the calls to populate and layout go through
wrappers in `src/dly_m4.c` that move four of the delay's widgets: FILT under Send, BEAT and PING into the empty 48 px
column on the left, PITCH and QUAD into column 5. Other panels get the stock positions. State lives in backup SRAM at `0x38800d00`.

## The master additions in detail

The master compressor (graph node `0x0a`, vtable `0x0806acb0`, event queue `0xc`, on the master bus) has its process
method `FUN_08042a90` (vtable slot `0x0806acbc`) replaced by `mst_process` (`src/mst_m7.c`, cave at `0x080A0000`). It
picks up Saturate (id `0x43`) from the compressor's queue, runs the stock compressor with its next-node link cleared
so it doesn't chain, reads its state (detector envelope at `+0xbc`/`+0xd4`, gain at `+0xc0`/`+0xd8`, threshold `+0xf4`
and makeup `+0xfc`, all log2 units; off when byte `+0x28` is set), saturates the bus, then runs the next node.

- Meter: the compressor's gain reduction, the larger of `MK - min(LG_L, LG_R)` and the gain curve applied to the louder
  detector level (`(1 - 1/ratio) (log2 env - T)`, soft-kneed; independent of the makeup), maxed over 32 blocks
  (about 21 ms) and written to backup SRAM at `0x38800f40` (`src/mst_shared.h`); about 210 instructions per block. On
  the M4 (`src/cm4_cpu.c`, in the flip hook) it's drawn while the settings page (`app + 0x1e9e8`, kind `0xc`) is
  current: the list (`page + 0x9c8`, laid out by `FUN_081400e2`) has rows of 0x330 bytes from `+0xe8` with their rect at
  `+4`, hidden byte `+0x30` and id at `+0x32c`; the bar goes in the bottom 3 px of the visible row with id `0x132`
  (the label starts 4 px up). The UI only redraws what changed, so `comp_tick` wraps the UI loop's redraw check
  (`FUN_0813aa9e`, `bl` at `0x081351a6`) and sets the page manager's force-redraw bytes (`app + 0x2b8/0x2b9`, as a page
  change does) when the gain reduction moved, at most every 3rd M7 report (~15 fps).
- Saturator: `y = x + mix (sat(g x) k - x)`, `g = 2^(6 Drive)` (0 to +36 dB), `k = R / sat(g R)` with R = 0.2
  (-14 dBFS), `sat(x) = x (27 + x^2) / (27 + 9 x^2)` (tanh-like, exactly ±1 from |x| = 3), `mix` fading in over the
  first 5 % of the knob. Changes ramp across a block. Skipped at 0 and on a silent bus. About 1300 instructions per
  32-sample block. No oversampling, so at high Drive there's some aliasing on bright material.
- Saturate is defined in the M4 param table next to the delay's (`src/dly_m4.c`, key `mstdrive`), added to the global
  param set after its last entry (`bl` at `0x08120b90` -> `mst_set_add`), and appended to the settings page's id list
  (`0x0814d966`).

## USB Out in detail

The USB device (ST USBD, UAC2, high speed, OTG_HS on the M7, no DMA) sends the computer 18 channels: the audio loop
packs each 32-frame block as 54-byte frames (18 x 24 bit; channels 13/14, bytes 36..41, are the master L/R) and writes
it to the IN ring (`bl` at `0x0804115a`), and the class DataIn (`FUN_08065db0`) sends 6 +-1 frames a microframe from it.
Master only (`src/usb_m7.c`, cave at `0x08090000`):

- The config descriptor is read from RAM (`0x240000a8`, 326 bytes), so it's edited in place: input terminal 4 and
  interface 2's AS general descriptor say 2 channels (front L/R), EP `0x82` a 48-byte max packet. Nothing else changes.
  The current mode is the descriptor itself, so a reset always starts as stock.
- `usb_push` keeps bytes 36..41 of each frame before the ring write; `usb_datain` (class slot `0x08076c40`) is the
  stock DataIn with 6-byte frames; class Init (`0x08076c2c`) sets the ring to 0x480 bytes (4 ms, as stock); the three
  fixed 324-byte sends (`0x08065ab4`, `0x08065d1a`, `0x08066640`) send 36 bytes. About 1600 instructions per block.
- The serial number gets an "M" (descriptor callback `0x08076c88`) so the computer doesn't mix up the two devices.
- Switching: the setting (id `0x59`, key `usbout`, defined in `src/dly_m4.c`, added to the global set and to the settings
  page's id list at `0x0814d91e`) reaches the compressor's queue and `mst_process` stores it (`0x38800f80`,
  `src/usb_shared.h`). `usb_tick` replaces the stock host-loss watchdog call (`bl` at `0x08041166`): when the setting
  differs from the descriptor it soft-disconnects (OTG `DCTL.SDIS`), edits the descriptor 20 ms later and reconnects
  at 250 ms, resetting the watchdog's state, which sits out meanwhile. Before USB has started it just edits.

Never commit firmware images: `*.bin` / `*.BIN` are git-ignored.

## How it works

The file holds three images back to back:

| file offset | flash address | what |
|---|---|---|
| 0x000000 | 0x08040000 | M7 main app: audio engine, USB audio |
| 0x0A0000 | 0x080E0000 | M7 microSD / USB storage mode |
| 0x0C0000 | 0x08100000 | M4 app: screen, UI, SD card, MIDI, presets |

The bootloader at 0x08000000-0x0803FFFF isn't in the file. New code goes in the zero-filled gap in the main image
(0x080B0000 for M7 code, 0x080B8000 for M4 code; the M4 can execute from bank 1), and a few `bl` instructions are
redirected to it. The file size doesn't change.

- **M7** (`src/cm7_cpu.c`): the audio callback `FUN_0804c778` already profiles itself with DWT cycle counts. We replace
  its profiler-exit call (`bl` at `0x0804ca10`), read back the {period, busy} pair it records, and publish the
  average and peak load to backup SRAM (`0x38800f00`).
- **M4** (`src/cm4_cpu.c`): the frame presenter `FUN_081385dc` blits each UI layer into an LTDC back buffer and flips.
  We replace the flip call (`bl` at `0x0813861a`) to draw the bar into the back buffer first.

- **Hall** (`src/hall_m7.c`, cave at `0x080C0000`): the reverb object's process method `FUN_08048de8` (vtable slot
  `0x0806adac`) is replaced by `hall_process`, which runs the stock engine unless one of styles 15-18 is selected. The setter
  call in the stock event loop (`bl` at `0x08048e56`) goes to `hall_set`, which remembers every reverb knob (in backup
  SRAM at `0x38800000`) and keeps styles 15+ from the stock setter, which only has 15 presets. It also saves and
  restores each style's knobs; `hall_echo` (the style-change echo, `bl` at `0x08048e6e`) then sends every panel knob
  back to the M4. The new engines use the stock engine's 1 MB delay memory, which is zeroed whenever it changes hands.
  Both cores' style name lists are copied with the new names and their count raised to 19. On the M4, the reverb
  slot's parameter list (`FUN_0812060c` case 5, `0x08120c1c`), which decides the panel's knobs, what presets save and
  what is re-sent to the M7, is rewritten as a table, and the panel's encoder pages for this slot go to 3.

`ghidra/` has headless import/decompile scripts (Ghidra 11.4.2 + its bundled pyghidra). `tools.py` has address and
branch helpers.
